adservice_f3,1,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;recommendationservice;cartservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The trace shows a high duration (14978 ms) and a non-zero status code (12.0) for the 'GetAds' operation of the adservice, which indicates a potential issue in the adservice itself as it is where the call originated. Hence, it is the most likely root cause. The frontend service is also implicated as it initiated the request, but the adservice is the direct point of failure."
adservice_f3,2,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;emailservice,"The top-ranked service is adservice, as the trace indicates a significant delay (27,388 ms) with a non-zero status code (12.0) specifically during the frontend's request to 'GetAds'. This suggests a problem at the adservice itself, especially since it had no outgoing dependencies reported in the graph, which could indicate service downtime or algorithmic issue in ad retrieval. The frontend is also ranked highly since it directly initiates the call that results in failure, potentially influencing the adservice. Other services are ranked lower as they are not directly implicated in this specific trace."
adservice_f3,3,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;emailservice,"The service 'adservice' is the most likely root cause as the trace indicates it generated the highest non-zero status code when receiving a request from 'frontend' for 'GetAds'. The high status code (12.0) points to a specific failure in the ad service, suggesting its potential malfunction is directly affecting the user experience, hence making it the first candidate for RCA."
adservice_f4,1,adservice,adservice;frontend;recommendationservice;cartservice;checkoutservice;currencyservice;shippingservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the adservice because the NullPointerException indicates that a null parameter was passed, possibly during the fetching or handling of ads. It is directly invoked when the frontend issues the GetAds command, making it the most probable service responsible for the error."
adservice_f4,2,adservice,adservice;frontend;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;cartservice;checkoutservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;emailservice,"The adservice is ranked first as it directly correlates with the reported error during the execution of the frontend request for advertisements. The NullPointerException indicates that the issue likely originates from the adservice, particularly in the getAds method. If the adservice fails to gather advertisements properly, it could lead to the frontend not receiving the expected data, thereby causing a visible malfunction to users."
adservice_f4,3,adservice,adservice;frontend;recommendationservice;cartservice;checkoutservice;productcatalogservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the adservice, as the stack trace indicates a NullPointerException in the getAds method of the AdService. This suggests that the service is trying to operate on a null collection, likely indicating a failure in data retrieval or preparation. Since the frontend directly calls the adservice, it is also ranked high due to its direct involvement and reliance on the adservice's response."
adservice_f5,1,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;cartservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the adservice because the trace indicates a problem with the hipstershop.AdService/GetAds method, which is directly tied to the failure to bind to the specified address. The stack trace reveals an IOException originating within the AdService itself, indicating that the service may not be properly initialized or configured, leading to its inability to handle requests from the frontend."
adservice_f5,2,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;cartservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;emailservice,"The adservice is ranked highest as the root cause because the trace indicates a failure while executing the GetAds method from the frontend, which directly calls the adservice. The stack trace highlights an IO exception 'Failed to bind to address', which suggests a critical configuration or network issue specifically within the adservice that prevents it from functioning properly. The adservice's inability to bind to the necessary address results in failure for the ad retrieval, making it the most likely root cause."
adservice_f5,3,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;shippingservice;cartservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;emailservice,"The adservice is the most likely root cause as it is directly mentioned in the stacktrace where the IOException occurred while attempting to bind to an address, indicating a potential failure in its network setup or configuration. Since the frontend is making calls to the adservice, any failure in the adservice could also impact the frontend, making it the second in the ranking."
cartservice_f1,1,cartservice,cartservice;frontend;checkoutservice;adservice;recommendationservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;shippingservice;emailservice,"The stack trace indicates that the issue is related to the cart storage in the cartservice, specifically a System.OverflowException while trying to add an item. This suggests that the cartservice is most likely the root cause of the problem as it directly handles the cart operations and encountered an overflow error."
cartservice_f1,2,cartservice,cartservice;frontend;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The primary error message indicates a 'System.OverflowException' arising from the 'cartservice', specifically while attempting to add an item to the cart. This suggests that the cartservice is unable to process the request due to an overflow error related to data handling. As the service directly executing the problematic code, it is the most likely root cause. The frontend is ranked next as it is the initiating service for this operation."
cartservice_f1,3,cartservice,cartservice;frontend;checkoutservice;shippingservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The top-ranked service is 'cartservice' because the stack trace reveals an overflow error occurring when attempting to add an item to the cart, indicating a likely issue directly within its implementation. The specific method 'AddItemAsync' is directly related to the operation that failed, making this service the most likely root cause."
currencyservice_f1,1,currencyservice,currencyservice;checkoutservice;frontend;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The trace indicates a non-zero status code (2.0) during the CurrencyService/Convert operation initiated by the frontend. As currencyservice is directly involved, it is ranked the highest since direct errors are indicative of service-level issues. Given that checkoutservice also relies on currencyservice for conversion operations, it is ranked next. The frontend is the initiator of the transaction and may also reflect issues, following closely behind."
currencyservice_f1,2,currencyservice,currencyservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;shippingservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The trace indicates a problem at the frontend while invoking the CurrencyService/Convert operation, which returned a status code of 2.0 (indicating an error). Since the currency service is the direct target of the operation, it is the most likely root cause of the issue, particularly considering the error occurred during an operation directly tied to this service."
currencyservice_f1,3,currencyservice,currencyservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The trace indicates that the frontend service experienced a non-zero status code (2.0) during the call to the CurrencyService for the Convert operation, suggesting a failure in that interaction. Given that the currencyservice is directly implicated in the failure, it is the most likely root cause. The subsequent ranking considers the importance of the frontend in initiating the call followed by checkoutservice which is responsible for coordinating operations including currency conversion."
emailservice_f1,1,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;frontend;cartservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;adservice;recommendationservice,"The checkoutservice is ranked highest as the likely root cause because it directly relates to the method in question, SendOrderConfirmation, which failed with a status code of 14. This indicates that there is likely an issue in how checkoutservice communicates with emailservice, where failures in sending the order confirmation could affect the overall ordering process."
emailservice_f1,2,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;cartservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;frontend;productcatalogservice;shippingservice;recommendationservice;adservice,"The most likely root cause is the checkoutservice because the trace indicates that the invocation of the SendOrderConfirmation method from the EmailService resulted in a non-zero status code (14.0). This suggests a problem within the checkoutservice that handles the order confirmation. Since it is directly responsible for sending the order confirmation email, issues within this service could lead to the status code observed."
emailservice_f1,3,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;cartservice;frontend;adservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice,"The emailservice is ranked as the most likely root cause because the trace indicates a failure with the SendOrderConfirmation operation, which is specifically handled by the emailservice. The status code 14 (UNAVAILABLE) suggests that the service might not be reachable or experiencing internal errors, which would prevent it from completing the operation initiated by checkoutservice."
emailservice_f2,1,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;frontend;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;cartservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice,"The most likely root cause is the 'emailservice' as the trace indicates a failure when sending an order confirmation via the operation 'hipstershop.EmailService/SendOrderConfirmation' with a status code of 14, which usually indicates an unavailable service or resource. Since this is directly related to the 'emailservice', it ranks highest in terms of being the root cause."
emailservice_f2,2,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;frontend;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice,"The emailservice is ranked as the most likely root cause because the trace indicates an error while attempting to send an order confirmation email. The status code 14 suggests a gRPC error, which often arises from issues with the service being called. Since checkoutservice directly depends on emailservice to send confirmations, faults in emailservice would directly impact the functionality of checkoutservice."
emailservice_f2,3,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;frontend,"The most likely root cause is the emailservice because the trace indicates a failure when trying to send the order confirmation (SendOrderConfirmation), which is directly linked to the emailservice. The error status code suggests a failure or issue in processing this specific service's request."
emailservice_f3,1,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;frontend,The checkoutservice is the most likely root cause because it is directly responsible for sending the order confirmation via email and has recorded the highest duration along with a non-zero status code. This indicates a potential failure or degradation in service that directly impacts the email notification functionality.
emailservice_f3,2,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;cartservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;frontend;shippingservice;currencyservice;recommendationservice;adservice,"The primary service involved in the trace with the non-zero status code is 'checkoutservice', which is directly responsible for sending the order confirmation through 'emailservice'. The status code indicates there may be an issue with the order confirmation process, likely originating from the checkout process itself."
emailservice_f3,3,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;frontend,"The most likely root cause is the checkoutservice, as it has a direct involvement in the operation that returned status code 12.0 during the email confirmation process (SendOrderConfirmation). This service is crucial for transaction flow and indicates a problem in processing orders, which is exacerbated by its subsequent dependency on the emailservice."
emailservice_f4,1,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;frontend,"The checkoutservice is the most likely root cause in this case, as the trace indicates a failure in 'SendOrderConfirmation' within the checkoutservice which has a high latency (23330 ms) and a non-zero status code (13). This directly points to an issue in the checkout service's response generation or communication with the email service."
emailservice_f4,2,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;frontend;shippingservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;adservice;recommendationservice,"The 'checkoutservice' is the most likely root cause because it directly sent the request to 'hipstershop.EmailService/SendOrderConfirmation' and the trace shows a significant duration and a non-zero status code (13.0). This indicates a problem likely originated within the checkout process, notably affecting the email confirmation functionality, essential for completing orders."
emailservice_f4,3,emailservice,checkoutservice;frontend;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;adservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The frontend service is making a call to the checkoutservice with a status code of 13.0, which usually indicates a permissions issue or an underlying service error. The checkoutservice is the most likely root cause as it directly processes the 'PlaceOrder' request from the frontend. If there is an issue within the checkoutservice (e.g., failing to communicate with downstream services or data validation issues), it would result in the failure of the whole operation, thus ranking it as the top suspected cause."
emailservice_f5,1,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;cartservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;frontend,"The top choice is the emailservice because the root cause is indicated to be associated with the status code 14.0 for the operation SendOrderConfirmation, which directly involves the emailservice.
