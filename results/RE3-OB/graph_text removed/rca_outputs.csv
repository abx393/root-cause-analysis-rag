adservice_f3,1,adservice,frontend;adservice;checkoutservice;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;currencyservice;emailservice,"The frontend service, having reported a high duration (14978) and a status code of 12.0 (indicating a client-side error), is the most likely candidate for the root cause as it directly interacts with the adservice to fetch ads. If the frontend is unable to handle the response correctly due to performance delays or errors, it could exacerbate the issue, particularly when combined with the adservice response inaccuracies."
adservice_f3,2,adservice,adservice;frontend;recommendationservice;cartservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;currencyservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the adservice since it directly correlates with the method 'GetAds' invoked by the frontend, which returned a failure status. The adservice is responsible for delivering ads, and any issues within it could directly affect the frontend request."
adservice_f3,3,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;emailservice,"The adservice is the direct source of the operation that encountered the non-zero status code during the GetAds method call. Since the issue originates from this service, it is the most likely root cause of the problem. A high duration of 11791 ms also suggests potential performance issues or errors within the adservice."
adservice_f4,1,adservice,adservice;frontend;recommendationservice;cartservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;currencyservice;checkoutservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the AdService ('adservice') because the stack trace indicates a NullPointerException occurring within the AdService when attempting to invoke a method on a null collection. Since the frontend attempts to fetch ads from the AdService and receives a non-zero status code (indicating an error), this service is the primary suspect for the failure."
adservice_f4,2,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;emailservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;shippingservice;cartservice,"The top choice is 'adservice' since the trace indicates a NullPointerException occurring within the GetAds method of the AdServiceImpl class. This suggests that the root cause is likely within this service where a null value is being processed, leading to the exception. Since this directly affects the ability of the frontend service to retrieve ads, it's the most likely origin of the issue."
adservice_f4,3,adservice,adservice;frontend;cartservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice;shippingservice;currencyservice;paymentservice;checkoutservice,"The most likely root cause of the issue is the AdService (adservice), which is indicated by the stack trace showing a NullPointerException occurring in the AdService's getAds method. This exception suggests that the service is attempting to process a null parameter, which is likely caused by either a failure in data retrieval from another service (like productcatalogservice or recommendationservice) or an internal bug. The frontend service triggered this request, making it the second in line for analysis, but the root cause is primarily within the adservice."
adservice_f5,1,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;shippingservice;recommendationservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the adservice, as it is the one directly involved in the operation that generated the 14.0 status code. The stack trace indicates that there was an IOException in the adservice related to binding to an address, which points to an issue in the adservice itself. The frontend service is next in the ranking since it is the client making the request to the adservice and could be affected by the service's inability to bind and respond properly."
adservice_f5,2,adservice,adservice;frontend;shippingservice;checkoutservice;cartservice;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;currencyservice;recommendationservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause is the adservice, as it encountered an exception while trying to bind to an address, which indicates it could not start properly. Since the frontend service relies on adservice to get ads, any issue in adservice can directly affect the frontend, reflected in the status code received during the GetAds operation."
adservice_f5,3,adservice,adservice;frontend;checkoutservice;cartservice;recommendationservice;shippingservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause of the issue is the adservice, as the exception indicates a failure to bind to the necessary network address, which would directly impact the ability to retrieve ads. Since the frontend service failed while trying to call the GetAds operation from the adservice, it's crucial to address the adservice first."
cartservice_f1,1,cartservice,cartservice;frontend;paymentservice;productcatalogservice;currencyservice;recommendationservice;shippingservice;adservice;checkoutservice;emailservice,"The primary root cause is likely within the 'cartservice' as indicated by the stack trace which highlights an 'OverflowException' when attempting to add an item to the cart. This suggests that 'cartservice' is unable to process the data being sent by the 'frontend' service due to an integer value exceeding the acceptable range, making it the most likely source of the issue. The 'frontend' service is also relevant as it initiated the request leading to the error."
cartservice_f1,2,cartservice,cartservice;frontend;emailservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;shippingservice;adservice;checkoutservice,"The error indicates a 'FailedPrecondition' status caused by an 'OverflowException' while attempting to access cart storage in the 'cartservice'. This suggests that the issue originated from the 'cartservice', which is handling the cart storage and item addition process. Other services are less likely to be root causes since they are not directly involved in the AddItem operation."
cartservice_f1,3,cartservice,cartservice;frontend;checkoutservice;productcatalogservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;adservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;emailservice,"The most likely root cause of the issue is the cartservice, as the error originates from its code when attempting to add an item to the cart. The stack trace indicates it caused a 'System.OverflowException' when attempting to parse a value that is out of range for an Int32, which is a direct indication of a problem within the cartservice itself."
currencyservice_f1,1,currencyservice,currencyservice;frontend;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;cartservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The top-ranked service is currencyservice because the trace indicates an operation related to currency conversion (hipstershop.CurrencyService/Convert). The status code is 2.0, which implies an error in the service that handles currency conversion directly. Given that the issue occurs during a critical operation related to the frontend, it suggests the currencyservice is the most likely root cause."
currencyservice_f1,2,currencyservice,currencyservice;frontend;checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;adservice;emailservice,"The root cause is most likely in the currencyservice, as the operation in the trace relates directly to the currency conversion functionality ('hipstershop.CurrencyService/Convert'). The frontend service is the next point of failure as it initiated the call to currencyservice. If the currencyservice fails, it could lead to the frontend receiving a non-zero status code (2.0). Other services, like checkoutservice and paymentservice, may indirectly cause failures based on currency conversion but are less likely to be the primary cause."
currencyservice_f1,3,currencyservice,currencyservice;frontend;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;cartservice;recommendationservice;adservice;productcatalogservice;emailservice,"The highest duration in the trace is linked with the CurrencyService which indicates it is taking an excessively long time to respond. Furthermore, the frontend service initiated this call, suggesting the issue is likely with the currency conversion itself."
emailservice_f1,1,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;frontend;adservice,"The 'checkoutservice' is the immediate service making the call that led to the error, and 'emailservice' is directly involved in sending the order confirmation, which is the operation that failed. The status code 14 indicates an internal error related to RPC, making 'emailservice' the most likely candidate for root cause since it's responsible for the actual sending of the email, which appears to have encountered a problem."
emailservice_f1,2,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;frontend;productcatalogservice;shippingservice;cartservice;adservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice,"The top choice is 'emailservice' because the error originates from the 'SendOrderConfirmation' operation which directly involves sending an email. Status code 14 typically indicates an UNAVAILABLE error, suggesting that the email service was not reachable or encountered issues while attempting to send the order confirmation. This makes it the most likely root cause."
emailservice_f1,3,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;shippingservice;cartservice;productcatalogservice;frontend;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The emailservice is ranked highest as the most likely root cause since the trace indicates an issue with sending an order confirmation email. The checkoutservice invoked the SendOrderConfirmation method, and the error status code (14.0) suggests a problem with the gRPC service communication, specifically related to the health check of the emailservice. This indicates that the emailservice could not confirm its availability or functionality, leading to the checkoutservice failing in its operation."
emailservice_f2,1,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;frontend;cartservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The primary operation that generated the non-zero status code is SendOrderConfirmation from the emailservice, which is directly invoked by the checkoutservice. The high-status code (14.0) indicates a potential issue with the email service itself, making it the most probable cause of the failure. The checkoutservice follows as it directly interacts with the email service, and failures there can also contribute to the error observed."
emailservice_f2,2,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;frontend;shippingservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The most likely root cause is the emailservice as it directly handles sending order confirmations. The status code 14 indicates an issue related to an unavailable service, and the stack trace highlights a failure in the email server during the execution of the SendOrderConfirmation method, pointing directly to a fault in the emailservice."
emailservice_f2,3,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;productcatalogservice;paymentservice;currencyservice;frontend;recommendationservice;shippingservice;cartservice;adservice,"The top ranked service is 'emailservice' because the issue originates from the 'SendOrderConfirmation' operation, which directly invokes this service. A non-zero status code 14 indicates an error related to a gRPC call, which often signifies a problem in the service receiving the call—in this case, the email service may be failing to process the request properly."
emailservice_f3,1,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;frontend;cartservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;adservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice,The checkoutservice is the most likely root cause as it directly involves sending the order confirmation (operation: SendOrderConfirmation) and the recorded status code indicates an error in that service. This suggests that an issue in checkoutservice directly affected the order confirmation process.
emailservice_f3,2,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;frontend;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The 'checkoutservice' is the primary service involved in sending the order confirmation, and it reported status code 12.0, indicating a likely failure in this service or its direct dependencies (like 'emailservice'). Thus, 'checkoutservice' is ranked as the most likely root cause since it's directly responsible for the operation and has reported issues."
emailservice_f3,3,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;frontend;shippingservice;recommendationservice;productcatalogservice;adservice;currencyservice,"The most likely root cause is the checkoutservice since it directly triggered the operation SendOrderConfirmation, which returned a non-zero status code of 12. This indicates a failure likely related to the sending of confirmation emails, suggesting a problem either in the checkoutservice's logic or its interaction with the emailservice."
emailservice_f4,1,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;orderconfirmationservice;cartservice;frontend;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;shippingservice;adservice,"The primary service involved in the trace is the checkoutservice, which is responsible for sending the order confirmation. Given the status code 13 (typically indicating an internal error or an unexpected situation), it's most likely that if the checkoutservice failed to successfully process the order confirmation, it is due to an issue within its implementation or interactions with directly related services such as emailservice. The checkoutservice's failure indicates potential problems with how it handles requests or relays information, making it the most immediate suspect for the root cause."
emailservice_f4,2,emailservice,checkoutservice;emailservice;paymentservice;cartservice;frontend;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The 'SendOrderConfirmation' method in 'checkoutservice' is the immediate context where the error occurred. A status code of 13 indicates an internal error, likely related to communication with the 'emailservice' which is responsible for sending order confirmations. Thus, 'checkoutservice' is the most likely cause since it directly initiated the call."
emailservice_f4,3,emailservice,checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice;emailservice;frontend,"The checkoutservice is directly related to the PlaceOrder operation, which is where the error occurred (status code 13). Therefore, it is the most likely root cause. Following that, the paymentservice and cartservice are also critical as they handle order payments and cart management, making them likely suspects if issues arose during the checkout process."
emailservice_f5,1,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;frontend;shippingservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The primary service involved in the error (status code 14.0) is the emailservice, due to its role in sending order confirmations. The error in the stacktrace directly suggests an implementation issue in the emailservice that has not been resolved yet. Since the checkoutservice is responsible for invoking the SendOrderConfirmation method, it is also closely linked to the problem but is secondary to the emailservice where the real error is originating from."
emailservice_f5,2,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;paymentservice;cartservice;shippingservice;frontend;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The most likely root cause for the error in the trace is the 'emailservice', as it is directly mentioned in the stack trace with a failure indicating a raised exception regarding non-implemented functionality. Since the 'checkoutservice' relies on successful communication with the 'emailservice' to send order confirmation, it ranks second in likelihood. Other services are less likely since they do not directly relate to the email communication failure indicated."
emailservice_f5,3,emailservice,emailservice;checkoutservice;frontend;paymentservice;shippingservice;cartservice;productcatalogservice;recommendationservice;currencyservice;adservice,"The most likely root cause is the emailservice, as it is directly related to the SendOrderConfirmation method call in the checkoutservice, which resulted in a non-zero status code (14). The stack trace indicates an exception raised in the emailservice due to non-implemented code, suggesting it's a direct failure affecting the order confirmation process."
